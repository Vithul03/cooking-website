                    My wife, Lorraine and I, are happy to share this special spot with you.
                    Come cast your eyes over the waves, the dolphins are regular visitors and certainly makes this
                    one of the most special places I have ever had the privilege spending time at on a daily basis</p>

                <H1>The Origin of the name Kitchen Windows</H1>
                <P>The name "Kitchen Windows" refers to the surf spot to the right of the restaurant.  
                    Jeffrey's Bay has always been one of the best fishing areas in South Africa.
                    The fishermen used to refer to the area now called Kitchen Windows as Little Reef.  
                    It became a popular surf spot during the 60's and the spot became known as
                    Kitchen Windows as the surfers of the time
                    looked through their kitchen window to see if the surf was firing. <br> <br><br>
                    
                    We are a family-friendly restaurant and believe in family values,
                    good wine and even better food.
                    We invite you to come and share this experience with us.
                    We have a grassy lawn to play on in front of the restaurant
                    â€‹and kids activity packs available, so please bring the family along. </P>
